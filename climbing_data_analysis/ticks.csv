Boulder, easy but fun climbing, crux boulder at bolt 7 (described below), one more crux after amazing horizontal shake. Going to anchors looks intimidating but the crimps on the slab are positive

Just too smoked today. 

First boulder: use the small, pebbly crimp for the right hand + a high left foot to reach the left hand sidepull. Not hard this way at all :) the pocket out to the right is not any good - slopey and in a bad position

At crux - where there’s tons of chalk - get two hands on crimps, high right foot with right hip in directly underneath two crimps, make a big lunge to a great hold. 

KEY: Get on, in either frigid temps OR while top is still in the shade for the crux. (Goes into sun around noon in late October)",https://www.mountainproject.com/route/106599268/orange-juice,1,"Kentucky > Red River Gorge > Northern Gorge > Funk Rock City",3.9,4,Lead,Fell/Hung,Sport,,90,7200

BEST and safest way to do it for sure, that way you aren’t doing the crux of the route over a ledge with a 100 feet of rope out. All pitch lengths remain the same 

Notes for next time:
1. On p1, when you get near end, there is a scary looking part. You get micro cams in a flaring crack and it looks like you have to pull this sloper overlap with bad feet - you don’t, there’s a huge jug rail to the left.
2. On last part, there’s a scary looking move above the piton. There’s a really flaring pin scar and an insecure move on slopers.
